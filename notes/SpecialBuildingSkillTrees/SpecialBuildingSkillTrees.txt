FIRST TIER
- SPECIAL 1a -	Lifewell: IF SOUL SUBJUGATOR CHOSEN: All units are granted additional health on spawn. Units
		respawned with Soul Subjugator lose this effect.

		sacrificed at an Unholy Ziggurat to immediately recharge the Unholy Ziggurat to the
		charge level it was previously at, minus one charge level.
		
		
I do not include the last tier of Technology tree buildings, because the variables set there are player
variables, since they're mostly powers that can be used globally, and are not just powers that affect
a specific unit or set of units like the Magic tree buildings.
