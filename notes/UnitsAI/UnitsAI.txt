			- While toggled, shimmering gold border around the icon.
			- Casts if in combat, and within range of 3 or more enemy units and buildings.
	- Shocktroopers:
		- Active ability, not able to be Auto Cast.
		- CPU AI set to cast at nearest enemy if all of the following are true:
			- Number of enemy units and buildings combined outnumbers the number of allied units
			  and buildings combined by more than 1.2x.
				- Prevents needless teleportations for fights that the CPU has a fair chance of
				  winning.
			- Enough Automatons are under control to turn the fight to less than a 1.2x numbers
			  advantage for the enemy.
				- Prevents teleporting Automatons to a fight they'll lose and die in because the
				  numbers advantage is not significantly affected.
			- An allied unit or building is in combat and has taken recent damage.
				- Prevents teleporting Automatons to the nearest enemy army if they're within
				  sight but not acting aggressive.

Acolyte:
	- Heal
		- Active ability, toggle with Right Click to turn on Auto Cast
			- While toggled, shimmering gold border around the icon.
			- Casts if not in combat and the friendly unit it's targeting is not in combat.
				- Focuses units with the lowest numerical HP value first.
				- Can be commanded to heal a specific unit, in which case the Acolyte will not
				  stop healing that unit until either of them enter combat, or it's target reaches
				  100% HP.
	- (MAGIC ONLY) Vitality Linked:
		- Active ability, requires 3 total Acolytes. Combine into one immovable formation. Not able
		  to be auto cast.
		- FORMATION
			- CPU AI set to form 3 Acolytes into Vitality Linked once if all of the following are true:
				- There are no Acolytes controlled that are currently in a Vitality Linked formation.
					- This prevents all Acolytes from being converted and no Acolytes left to normally
					  heal.
				- There are more than 3 Acolytes controlled.
					- This prevents the first 3 Acolytes from immediately being converted into Vitality
					  Linked formation.
					- This ensures that a Vitality Linked formation forms relatively quickly, but not
					  immediately.
		- VITALITY LINKED HEAL
			- CPU AI set to cast Vitality Linked heal if all of the following are true:
				- There are Acolytes controlled that are currently in a Vitality Linked Formation.
					- Impossible to cast otherwise.
				- The unit(s) to heal are not outnumbered by more than 1.2x.
					- Prevents a heal from being wasted on a fight that is likely lost.
				- If target is a single unit, the target is missing more HP than it's enemy but will
				  have more HP than it's enemy once it's healed.
					- Ensures that a heal on a single unit is almost guaranteed to save the unit's life.
				- If target location is a group of friendly units, 2+ targets are missing HP, and at
				  least one of the targets will not be overhealed.
					- Ensures that the heal on a group affects more than a single unit.
					- Ensures that the heal on a group will not be immediately wasted once 2+ units
					  take the smallest amount of damage.

Subverter:
	- 
	
Wizard:
	- Fireball:
		- Active ability, toggle with Right Click to turn on Auto Cast
			- While toggled, shimmering gold border around the icon.
			- Casts if off cooldown.
				- Fireball deals more damage than the Wizard's basic attack (Magic Missiles) and so it
				  should be used regardless of whether the AoE effect will hit other enemies or not.
	- (MAGIC ONLY) Fire Linked:
		- Active ability, requires 3 total Wizards. Combine into one immovable formation. Not able
		  to be auto cast.
		- FORMATION
			- CPU AI set to form 3 Acolytes into Fire Linked if all of the following are true:
				- There are more than 3 controlled Wizards not currently in a Fire Linked formation.
					- This does allow for multiple Fire Linked formations to appear, as long as a Wizard
					  is still active and under control that isn't part of a Fire Linked formation after
					  the next formation is created.
				- After the first is created, there are slowly increasing requirements to form the next
				  Fire Link.
					- E.g. after the first Fire Linked formation, there must be 2 Wizards active in
					  addition to the next 3 that will be used in the next Fire Link. After the third
					  Fire Link, there must be 3 Wizards active in addition to the next 3 that will be
					  used in the next Fire Link, and so on.
		- FIRE LINKED METEOR
			- CPU AI set to cast Fire Linked meteors if all of the following are true:
				- There are Wizards controlled that are currently in a Fire Linked formation.
					- Impossible to cast otherwise.
				- The target is not a solo unit.
					- The requirement must increase by 1 unit as each additional Fire Linked formation
					  is created. Target count must equal 1 + n, where n is the number of Fire Linked
					  formations active and under control.
				- The target is near allied units.
					- This prevents hitting enemies that are nowhere near being threatened, and then
					  just retreating and immediately healing all of the damage taken.
				- Prioritizes lower health targets.
					- The goal is not only poke damage but to secure kills that are otherwise out of
					  reach.
	- (TECH ONLY) Redirect:
		- Active ability, toggle with Right Click to turn on Auto Cast
			- While toggled, shimmering gold border around the icon.
			- Casts if off cooldown, friendly target has very recently taken damage, friendly target
			  has enemy units within ranged unit range, a friendly Knight is within range, the friendly
			  target is over 1/4 HP, the friendly target is not a Knight, and the Knight to Redirect 
			  to is over 1/2 HP.
				- Prioritizes units with the most enemy units within range.
					- If there's a tie, compare number of enemy units within melee range, and
					  prioritize the friendly unit that has more units in melee range.
						- If there's still a tie, cast Redirect on the unit that most recently took
						  damage.
				- If no friendly units have very recently taken damage, cast Redirect on a friendly
				  unit that has an enemy unit within melee range, and which enemy unit is not a Worker.
					- This avoids Wizards from needlessly casting Redirect on friendly units that are
					  attacking enemy Workers.
				- Does not Redirect a Knight to a Knight to avoid absurd resist values and weird
				  interactions.
