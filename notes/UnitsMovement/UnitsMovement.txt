When adding any new type of interactable object(s) (unit, resource, building, etc.), the following
needs to be adjusted:
	- The functions in unit_move(), which deal with searching for valid locations
	  around differently sized objects for different types of ranged and melee objects.

Pathfinding only works with objects if their origin is set to the top left of the bottom left pixel.
Otherwise, it'll be thrown off.



to do:
clicking on the same target object after the object has already pathfound to the same original
target object causes it to no longer target an object, and just move to closest location instead.
objectTarget and objectTargetList must be being erased somewhere along the line to cause this.
