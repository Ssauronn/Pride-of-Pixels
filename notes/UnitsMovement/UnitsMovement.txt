When adding any new type of interactable object(s) (unit, resource, building, etc.), the following
needs to be adjusted:
	- The functions in unit_move(), which deal with searching for valid locations
	  around differently sized objects for different types of ranged and melee objects.

Pathfinding only works with objects if their origin is set to the top left of the bottom left pixel.
Otherwise, it'll be thrown off.



to do:
pathfinding for targets now works for melee units (mostly). However, the search pattern for secondary
targets (the grid search pattern) is... weird, and needs to be fixed. At the moment, it kinda chooses
randomly placed objects everywhere.
