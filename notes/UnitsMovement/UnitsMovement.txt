When adding any new type of interactable object(s) (unit, resource, building, etc.), the following
needs to be adjusted:
	- The functions in unit_move(), which deal with searching for valid locations
	  around differently sized objects for different types of ranged and melee objects.

Pathfinding only works with objects if their origin is set to the top left of the bottom left pixel.
Otherwise, it'll be thrown off.
