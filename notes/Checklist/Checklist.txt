- Fog of War
    - 3 levels
        - TUTORIAL: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemaker/comments/87skcw/how_to_make_a_fog_of_war/
            - Entirely black, unexplored region
            - Entirely revealed, explored and currently within sight range of a friendly building or unit
            - Halfway black, explored but not currently within sight range of a friendly building or unit

- Mini Map
    - TUTORIAL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfJy0-NTTA
    - Entire map reduced 16:1
        - If a map with the size of 7040 pixels was reduced to 1 pixel per 16 pixels, the mini map would be 440 pixels wide, which translates to a mini map that looks 220 pixels wide (since the GUI is double the resolution of the game camera).
        - A square this size placed on the bottom corner would still leave room for the toolbar and space on either side.
    - After mini map is draw, Fog of War is drawn onto the mini map using another scaled down version of the Fog of War.
    - Units only update their position on the mini map if their floored 16x16 grid location was not equal to the previous frame's grid location (keeping updating as low as possible, only occuring when the unit actually moves into a different grid location).
    - Any buildings or resources only update their drawn location twice, once when they're created and once when they're destroyed.
